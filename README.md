# Woocommerce Orders to Votes 

** This is not near being useful ... yet **

* Uses the Woocommerce Api v2 
` "automattic/woocommerce": "^1.3"`

Reads an order item which has a specific variation attribute and parses them as vote total
eg.: 100-voting-points \[attribute\] will become just 100 * lineItem QTY

### Usage
* currently just add you api keys to the .env file
* composer install obviously everything
